Data file description:
1. cannot handle "increase" for bars. Can handle accumulcation and decrease;
2. for bars in hierarchical bar, their signs should be the same. They will start at the y=0 and grow upward.
u can't tell which is positive or which is negative by just looking at y axis values. But u can tell by
hovering your mouse on specific bar and it will show the real value.
